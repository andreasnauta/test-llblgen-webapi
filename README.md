# Introduction
This is a test repository for testing ASP.NET Core Web Application with LLBLGen. It's been created rather quickly to test a few things and is therefore missing things like unit test.

# Requirements
- SQL Server 2017 Express Edition.

# Usage (not tested on other computers yet)
1: Run the script in the SQL folder to create the database.
2: Change the connection string in the StartUp.cs class in the WebAPI project (if it is anything else than localhost).
3: Run the WebAPI project.

The code generated by LLBLGen is already included, so there should be no need to do anything else.

# Testing new stuff
The LLBLGen project used to create both the SQL and generate the code is included.
